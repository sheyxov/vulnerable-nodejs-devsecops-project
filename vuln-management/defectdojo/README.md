# Vulnerability Management – DefectDojo

This directory documents the **vulnerability management integration**
used in the DevSecOps pipeline.

The project uses **DefectDojo** to centralize and manage security findings
generated by multiple security tools.

## Why DefectDojo?

DefectDojo provides:
- Centralized vulnerability tracking
- Tool-agnostic import support
